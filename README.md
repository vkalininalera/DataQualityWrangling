### Project Description

This project focuses on data preprocessing, data quality management, and feature engineering using the Ames Housing dataset.
The main objective is to prepare a clean, structured, and transformed dataset suitable for exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning modeling.

### The workflow includes:

Feature selection,

Handling missing values,

Feature transformation and construction,

Complexity/dimensionality reduction,

Statistical analysis and visualization,

Export of a final cleaned dataset.
